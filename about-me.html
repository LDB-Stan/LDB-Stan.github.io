				<h1>About Me</h1>
			
		<p>
			 As often comes up in job interviews, as well as social events where people may meet for the first time, being presented with the non-question, “Tell me a little about yourself”, always elicits the same initial thought: “Could you please be a little more specific?” Nonetheless, that’s how I’ll go about writing the content of this page.
		</p><p>
			The first thing I should disclose is that I like to write. You’ve been warned.
		</p><p>
			In response to the aforementioned non-question, first of all, I’d  say that I’m unique, just like everyone else. I think that statement in itself speaks volumes to those who understand the tongue-in-cheek paradox of it.
		</p><p>
			People have told me that I'm a skeptic, but I don't believe them.
		</p><p>
			I have no problem in changing my views on a subject when presented with new information.
		</p><p>
			If asked what my greatest passion is, I’d say that it’s learning. I’m on a lifelong quest for knowledge  of anything and everything that piques my curiosity, including those fleeting “shower thoughts”. I feel quite fortunate to share the same period in human history with the likes of Google and Wikipedia. This sort of technology is truly a boon to those of us who are constantly curious.
		</p><p>
			While I don’t necessarily consider it to be a passion, I’ve come to discover that I enjoy problem solving, as mentioned on the home page. Even the majority of my hobbies are centered around a form of problem solving: jigsaw puzzles, scale model building, even that sudoku app that I’ve wasted so much time on.
		</p><p> 
			Through studying data analysis, I’ve also grown quite fond of mathematics, which itself can provide a literally infinite number of puzzles to solve. Language has always been my core aptitude, so this newfound fascination with mathematics has been somewhat exciting.
		</p><p>
			Inasmuch as this has become something that I really tend to enjoy, depending on the situation, I don’t <em>seek out</em>  problems to solve. To paraphrase something that my dad used to tell me when I was a kid, “Don’t look for problems; they’ll find you.” I’ve never found less than complete truth in this statement.
		</p><p>
			In my view, the key to solving problems doesn’t lie in just having the answers; it lies in asking the right questions. This comes after observing the all of the known variables, or potential variables, related to the objective at hand. For many situations, this core principle is how I begin.
		</p>
		<p>
			Returning the the self-summary, I’ll continue with a few inconsequential tidbits.
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Favorite novel: <em>Welcome to Xanadu</em> by Nathaniel Benchley</li>
					<li> Favorite non-fiction work: <em>Cosmos</em> by Carl Sagan</li>
					<li>Hogwarts House: Ravenclaw (That’s a 2-for-1)</li>
					<li>I do not own a television.</li>
					<li>I do not use social media.</li>
				</ul>
		</p>
        <p>I’ll also answer a couple of those trendy job interview questions.
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>If I could be any non-human animal, I’d be an octopus. Their cunning coupled with their problem solving capabilities makes them nothing less than amazing. Plus, some species can survive outside of water for up to an hour. Now <em>that’s</em> adapting to adversity.</li>
				<li>Given the usual selection of superpowers, I’d choose invisibility. Aside from occasions related to healthcare concerns, I struggle to imagine a scenario when being invisible would be any sort of disadvantage.</li>
			</ul>
