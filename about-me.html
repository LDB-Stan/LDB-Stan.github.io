				<h1>About Me</h1>
			
		<p>
			 As often comes up in job interviews, as well as social events where people may meet for the first time, being presented with the non-question, “Tell me a little about yourself”, always elicits the same initial thought: “Could you please be a little more specific?” Nonetheless, that’s how I’ll go about writing the content of this page.
		</p><p>
			The first thing I should disclose is that I like to write. You’ve been warned.
		</p><p>
			In response to the aforementioned non-question, first of all, I’d  say that I’m unique, just like everyone else. I think that statement in itself speaks volumes to those who understand the tongue-in-cheek paradox of it.
		</p><p>
			People have told me that I'm a skeptic, but I don't believe them.
		</p><p>
			I have no problem in changing my views on a subject when presented with new information.
		</p><p>
			If asked what my greatest passion is, I’d say that it’s learning. I’m on a lifelong quest for knowledge  of anything and everything that piques my curiosity, including those fleeting “shower thoughts”. I feel quite fortunate to share the same period in human history with the likes of Google and Wikipedia. This sort of technology is truly a boon to those of us who are constantly curious.
		</p><p>
			While I don’t necessarily consider it to be a passion, I’ve come to discover that I enjoy problem solving, as mentioned on the home page. Even the majority of my hobbies are centered around a form of problem solving: jigsaw puzzles, scale model building, even that sudoku app that I’ve wasted so much time on.
		</p><p> 
			Through studying data analysis, I’ve also grown quite fond of mathematics, which itself can provide a literally infinite number of puzzles to solve. Language has always been my core aptitude, so this newfound fascination with mathematics has been somewhat exciting.
		</p><p>
			Inasmuch as this has become something that I really tend to enjoy, depending on the situation, I don’t <em>seek out</em>  problems to solve. To paraphrase something that my dad used to tell me when I was a kid, “Don’t look for problems; they’ll find you.” I’ve never found less than complete truth in this statement.
		</p><p>
			In my view, the key to solving problems doesn’t lie in just having the answers; it lies in asking the right questions. This comes after observing the all of the known variables, or potential variables, related to the objective at hand. For many situations, this core principle is how I begin.
		</p>
		<p>
			Returning the the self-summary, I’ll continue with a few inconsequential tidbits.
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Favorite novel: <em>Welcome to Xanadu</em> by Nathaniel Benchley</li>
					<li> Favorite non-fiction work: <em>Cosmos</em> by Carl Sagan</li>
					<li>Hogwarts House: Ravenclaw (That’s a 2-for-1)</li>
					<li>I do not own a television.</li>
					<li>I do not use social media.</li>
				</ul>
		</p>
        <p>I’ll also answer a couple of those trendy job interview questions.
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>If I could be any non-human animal, I’d be an octopus. Their cunning coupled with their problem solving capabilities makes them nothing less than amazing. Plus, some species can survive outside of water for up to an hour. Now <em>that’s</em> adapting to adversity.</li>
				<li>Given the usual selection of superpowers, I’d choose invisibility. Aside from occasions related to healthcare concerns, I struggle to imagine a scenario when being invisible would be any sort of disadvantage.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>That out of the way, with the use of a couple of hyperlinks, I’ll reveal the meaning of my GitHub username. &nbsp;&nbsp;
			<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000304/" target="_blank"><b>LDB</b></a>-<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Stan" target="_blank"><b>Stan</b></a>
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>Finally, for those who made it this far, and have nothing better to do right now, if I had to summarize the core of my philosophy of life, it could be done with three quotes, all from the science community. Starting from the outside and working inward, so to speak; cosmically, of course.</p>
		
	

	<p class="quote">	
		<em>“Your planet is a tiny speck in a void of interplanetary space.  Your sun is one of a hundred billion other stars in your galaxy. Your galaxy is one of 50 or 100 billion other galaxies in the universe.  Does this make you feel enlightened or depressed?
			<br><br>
		I assert that if you were depressed after learning and being exposed to this perspective, you started your day with an unjustifiably large ego.” </em>

		<div>
			<p>
			<em>Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there -- on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. 
			</p><p>
			The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.
			</p><p>
			Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
			</p><p>
			The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.
			</p><p>
			It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known. </em>
			</p><p>

		<em>“We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains the Sahara. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people.  In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;…
			<br>
		We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?” </em>
